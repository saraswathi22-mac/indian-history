      <h2>How Mughals came to India</h2>
      <p>Mughal dynasty, mughal also spelled mogul, persian mughul('Mongol'), muslim dynasty of turkic-mongol origin that ruled most of the northern india from the early 16th - mid 18th century</p>
      <p>In the early 16th century, descendants of the mongol, turkish, iranian and afghan invaders of south asia--the mughals-invaded india under the leadership of zahid-ud-bin babur.</p>
      <h3>Babur</h3>
      <p>He was the great grandson of Timur Lenk(Timur the Lame, from which the Western name Tamerlane is derived), who had invaded india and plundered Delhi in 1398 and then led a short lived empire based in Samarkand(in modern time Uzbekistan) that united Persian-based mongols(baburs maternal ancesters) and other west asian peoples.</p>
      <h2>Political scenario on the eve of baburs invasion</h2>
      <p>The first half of the 15th century witnessed political instability with the disintegration of the Tugluq dynasty. Both the saiyyad(1414-1451) and the Lodi(1451-1526) rulers failed to cope with the disruptive forces.
        - The political chaos in the north-west provinces had weekened the centre
        - In central India, the power of Sultan Mahmud Khalji II of Malwa was on the decline.
      </p>
      <p>In central Asia and Persia: 
        - By the close of the 15th century, the power of the Timurids was on the decline. By this time the Uzbegs succeeded in establishing strong footholds in Transoxiana under Shaibani Khan.
        - In 1510, Shah Ismail of Iran defeated Shaibani khan and the ottoman sultan defeated Shah Ismail.
        - Babur ascended the throne at Farghana (a small principality in Transoxiana) in 1494 at the tender age of 12
        - However, it was not a smooth succession for babur. Both the mongol khans as well as the timurid princes, specially Sultan Ahmed Mirza of samarkhand, an uncle of babur, had interests in Farghana. Besides, babur had to face the discontented nobility.
        - Against all odds babur struggled to strengthen his foothold in central asia and did succeed in taking samarqand twice(1497, 1500)
        - But he could hardly told that for long. With Shaibani Khans success over Khorasan one of the 4 timurid centres of power finally sealed baburs fate in cemtral asia and he was left with no option but to look towards Kabul where the conditions were most favourable.
        - Its ruler Ulugh Beg Mirza had already died (1501). Babur occupied Kabul in 1504. Yet babur could not completely leave the dream to rule over Central Asia. With the help of Shah Ismail' defeat in 1512 and the resurgence of the Uzbegs left Babur with no alternative but to consolidate himself in Kabul.
        - Thus it was the Central asian situation which pressed and convinced (after 1512) babur to abandon the hopes of creating an empire in Central Asia and look towards India.
        - The rich resources of India and the merge income of Afghanistan might have been another attraction for babur
        - The unstable political situation after Sikander Lodi's death convinced him of political discontentment and disorder in the lodi empire.
        - Invitations from Rana Sanga and daulat khan lodi, the governor of Punjab, might have whetted Baburs ambitions.
        - Perhaps Timurs legacy also provided some background for his invasion.
        - Thus, Babur had both reasons and opportunity to took towards India.

      <h3>Skirmishes before the Battle of Panipat</h3>
      <p>
        1. At Bhira(1519-1520), the gateway of Hisdustan
        2. At Siakot(1520)
        3. At Lahore(1524)
        And then, finally Ibrahim Lodi and Baburs forces met at the historic battlefield of Panipat. The battle lasted for just few hours in favour of Babur. This battle shows Baburs skill in the art of warfare. His soldiers were less in number but the organisation was superior. Ibrahims forces though many times greater in number(aprox 100000 soldiers and 1000-500 elephants as compared to baburs 12000 horseman) faired badly. Babur successfully applied the Rumi(Ottoman) method of warfare.
      </p>
      <h3>First Battle of panipat</h3>
      <p>Afghan casualities reported by Babur were approx 20000 including the Sultan Ibrahim Lodi. In the battle it was not Baburs artillery  but his 'superb tactics' and the 'mounted archers' played the decisive role, a fact which babur himself acknowledged.</p>
      <p>The battle of panipat, though, formally established the mughal rule in india, it was first among the series of battles in the years to come. For example to secure this triumph, it was equally important to overcome Rana Sanga of Mewar and the chieftains in and around Delhi and Agra. Another opponent in the eastern India was the afghans. To add to this, problems were mounting within his notability.</p>
